    have a variable storing the text as either string or array for comparisons
Create ranking categories 
    Have 9  arrays with looping conditional requirements for each rank specification
Define methods for the rankings
  Have about 9+ methods each comparing which rank does the inputted string belong to
  Searching method  -to compare in which ranking category - use the method
    Loop through the inputted text and check conditions  - If the values are meet for a specific rank definition
          Then return that rank defination
      Condition: if a value of an element in the text-inputted contained in a any of the values in the order rank 
          place it in some temporary array
  Sorting method    - to compare in which  category does the temparary array fall under
    Loop through every element in the inputted text and compare it with each ranking category
      condition: if these 2 arrays are the same
