This program will accept text input of playing cards for evaluating what the best poker hand could be constructed with the cards.

Get the necessary  Java library  imports
Get  input from user  
Account for the validity of the  text input  
    use the try catch statement// or used the exception class or assert statements
        have suits and numericals checked from the user string input
                By creating arrays for suits and for numbericals (numericals of string data type) -- 
                            the suits array of type char and the numericals named rank of type string
Store the text input 
?? find a way to split this string such that values for the suit and values 
    have a variable storing the text as either string or array or arrayList for comparisons
Create ranking categories 
    Have 9  arrays with looping conditional requirements for each rank specification 
        populate each array with suit conditions and numbers conditions
Define methods for the rankings // try with Enums
  Have about 9+ methods each comparing which rank does the inputted string belong to
  Searching method  -to compare in which ranking category - use the method
    Loop through the inputted text and check conditions  - If the values are meet for a specific rank definition
          Then return that rank defination
      Condition: if a value of an element in the text-inputted contained in a any of the values in the order rank 
          place it in some temporary array
  Sorting method    - to compare in which  category does the temparary array fall under
    Loop through every element in the inputted text and compare it with each ranking category
        Use the Java 8 comparator.comparing()  
      condition: if these 2 arrays are the same 
      then return the name of the category
